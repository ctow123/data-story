  <h1> Data Collection </h1>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2>Abstract - The Goal</h2>
      <p> Data collection at its core is a way for society to achieve expediancy or doing things efficiently.
        Collection techniques embody this modern compulsion for compression, calculation, and circulation of information. The act
        of collection itself brings up ethical questions about privacy</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2>Creating Data</h2>
      <p>Any activity you do, online or offline, creates data that can be captured. The activity I choose to record was
        my searches to see how I allocate my time. Google already does this practice for searches on its engine</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item" id="last">
      <h2>Capturing Data</h2>
      <p> To collect data, you have to choose what metrics to track.
        This reveals the ehtics and values of a society as data is not collected for fun, but serves a purpose. Oftentimes these
        metrics can have a profound effect on what trends and groups are represented as metrics have inherent biases</p>

  <h1> Data Processing </h1>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2>Abstract - The Goal</h2>
      <p>Data processing is a process of transformation. The organization and
        classification pattern of how data is captured and processed is revealing about ethical code of
        the collector and society.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2>Pre-processing</h2>
      <p>Data sets need to be pre-processed to be run through algorithms and visualized. This involves organizing the data by
        classifcation of points and potential removal of extraneous values</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item" id="last">
      <h2>Algorithms</h2>
      <p> Algorithms are a way of filtering and presenting revelvant data to us. Some problems are transparency
        as algos are generally blackboxes. This is problematic because we accept algos as presenting the unbiased truth
        , when algo can have lots of biases</p>

  <h1> Data Visualization </h1>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2>Abstract - The Goal</h2>
      <p> visualization shows the purpose it served understand the world around us, things perhaps invisible to the eye</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2>Charts and Videos</h2>
      <p>These help display trends and infomation from the raw data in
        a human readable fashion. However, these aren't limited to just bar and pie charts, but can be like the Dear Data Project.
      The visualization is yet another layer in which infomation can be encoded</p>
