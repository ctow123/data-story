    <h1> Data Collection </h1>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Abstract - The Goal</h2>
        <p> Data collection at its core is a way for society to achieve expediancy or doing things efficiently.
          Collection techniques embody this modern compulsion for compression, calculation, and circulation of information. The act
          of collection itself brings up ethical questions about privacy</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Creating Data</h2>
        <p>Any activity you do, online or offline, creates data that can be captured. The activity I choose to record was
          my searches to see how I allocate my time. Google already does this practice for searches on its engine</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item" id="last">
        <h2>Capturing Data</h2>
        <p> To collect data, you have to choose what metrics to track.
          This reveals the ehtics and values of a society as data is not collected for fun, but serves a purpose. Oftentimes these
          metrics can have a profound effect on what trends and groups are represented as metrics have inherent biases</p>

    <h1> Data Processing </h1>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Abstract - The Goal</h2>
        <p>Data processing is a process of transformation. The organization and
          classification pattern of how data is captured and processed is revealing about ethical code of
          the collector and society.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Pre-processing</h2>
        <p>Data sets need to be pre-processed to be run through algorithms and visualized. This involves organizing the data by
          classifcation of points and potential removal of extraneous values</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item" id="last">
        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p> Algorithms are a way of filtering and presenting revelvant data to us. Some problems are transparency
          as algos are generally blackboxes. This is problematic because we accept algos as presenting the unbiased truth
          , when algo can have lots of biases. For my project, I used excel formulas to filter out my raw data sheet</p>

    <h1> Data Visualization </h1>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Abstract - The Goal</h2>
        <p> Visualization shows the purpose the data served, which reflects societal values.
          The visualizations help ciruclation the compressed data collected. Furthur, they help us understand
          the world around we live in and notice trends perhaps invisible to the eye</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Charts and Videos</h2>
        <b>Click on image above for full size</b>
        <p>These help display trends and infomation from the raw data in
          a human readable fashion. However, these aren't limited to just bar and pie charts, but can be like the Dear Data Project or my visualization above.
          The visualization is yet another layer in which infomation can be encoded</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item" id="last">
        <h2>My Data Viz</h2>

        <p> Some trends where the hardest content I searched for was usually internally motivated, while
          my environment presented me with easier problems to address. Also, the hardest searches also proved more
          focused on a few topics, while time devoted to medium to easier searches was spread out over lots of topics.
          This makes sense, since easier topics generally consume less time</p>

        <h1>The Dangers of Data and Algorithms - Amazon Study</h1>

        <div class="grid-container" style="padding-top: 20px">
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Companies collect hundreds of data points on customers unknowningly and
              feed that data into various algorithms. The end results
              manifest themselves in the form of recommendations, advertisiments, or actions taken based on
              probablistic events. For example, data and algos in policing have led to preventing crime by prediction </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h2>Other Ramifactions</h2>
            <p>Two big problems are the privacy of the user as data is traded and sold. While mostly harmless individually, all the data points
              put together poise a bigger threat. The second problem is lack of transparency in algorithms, which may led to actions
              based on untrue or manipulated results due to the algo flaws</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item" id="last">
            <h2>Possible Reguluations</h2>
            <p>Privacy by accountability. Create a government agency (Federal Data Comission?) that monitors companies data and
              algorithmic practices for malicious intent. This would give citizens recourse over companies already engaged in shady data practices</p>
